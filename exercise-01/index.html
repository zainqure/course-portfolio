        <h1>Exercise 01: Create and Deploy Your Course Portfolio</h1>

        <h2>Prompt</h2>

        <p>Set up your professional development environment, create the repository for your Course Portfolio, and deploy a simple Course Homepage to the live internet using GitHub Pages.</p>

        <h2>Detailed Explanation</h2>

        <p>This single, comprehensive exercise requires you to run through the entire setup and deployment process. By the end, you will have a live, public URL that will serve as the central homepage for all your coursework this semester.</p>

        <h2>Exercise Instructions</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Read "Setting up Your Course Portfolio" in the Week 02 module. Follow the instructions it provides.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Edit your Homepage File:</strong> Inside your cloned repository folder, open the <span style="color: red;">index.html</span></style;> file, and edit it using VS Code. Change the placeholder text with your information, as you prefer. Save your file changes when finished.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Commit and Push:</strong> In GitHub Desktop, commit the edited file with a descriptive message (such as, "Initial commit: Update my course homepage text") and push the changes to GitHub.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Check Your Live URL:</strong> Wait about two minutes. Your live homepage URL is the one you saw when setting up your course portfolio. Your homepage should now be live on the web.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Exercise Submission Details</h2>

        <p>Your submitted URL must be live and publicly accessible, and the page must display your name and any other personalized information you have added.</p>
